# Synesthesia Games

A suite of tools that allow various interactions with Synethesia with the goal of creating new types of sport games.

Examples of usage: 
- Position microphones
  - around a table. As players drums on the table, various parameters are changed in Synesthesia. Present synethesia on a screen or projected on to the table.
  - in the corners of a squash court and project the image(s) onto the wall(s), floor and/or ceiling. Now moving around the court has an impact on the game as well

- Detect impact point (not yet implemented)
  - Use a camera for object tracking, e.g. a Pixy cam. Map the imapct to x/y properties in synesthesia.

This extends to various sports and games.
